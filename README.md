## Building from Source üõ†Ô∏è

To build Clipper from source, you'll need to have Go installed on your system, as well as the Make tool.

### Requirements:
- **Go Lang:** Clipper is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).
- **Make Tool:** Building Clipper from source requires the Make tool to automate the build process. Make is commonly pre-installed on Unix-like systems, but you may need to install it manually on Windows.

Once you have the necessary requirements installed, clone the repository and run the following command in the project directory:

```sh
make
```

This command will build binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS in the `bin` directory.
